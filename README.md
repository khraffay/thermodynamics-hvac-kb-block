 HVAC Load Analysis – KB Block

This project estimates total thermal load in KB Block using thermodynamics principles and proposes a central HVAC system using R-134a refrigerant. Calculations are performed on EES.

 Highlights:
Real-world thermal modeling
R-134a vapor compression cycle
Heat gain from humans, electronics, and sunlight
Simulation outputs: COP, enthalpy, mass flow, etc.

 Software:
EES (Engineering Equation Solver)
MS Excel (Data tabulation)

 Result:
Required cooling capacity ≈ 58.68 kW
System COP ≈ 4.91
Recommended system: HVAC25 (Coowor)
